# Arduino library
The Arduino library provides the code running on the board's microcontroller.

## Installation
Clone this repo into `YOUR_ARDUINO_FOLDER/libraries/`.

## Usage
If you're just interested in using the board with a script or the app, you'll want
to run the `serial_binboard` sketch from the library's examples folder.
