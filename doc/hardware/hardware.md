# Hardware
## Components
These are the components I used, but you should be able to find alternatives
for most of them if necessary.
- **SparkFun Pro Micro (5V, 16MHz)**
- **64 photoresistors**
- **72 diodes**
- **Shift register**
- **8 resistors**
- **Cables and soldering supplies**

For potential alternatives, see [Design decisions](design-decisions).

## Cost
The electronics used in this project cost me around 35€, divided as follows:

| Part | Price |
| --- | --- |
| Pro micro | 10€ |
| Photoresistors | 13€ (for 350 pcs) |
| Shift register | 1€ |
| Cables, diodes, etc. | ~10€ |

This is significantly cheaper than commercial alternatives, which cost several hundred Euros.
