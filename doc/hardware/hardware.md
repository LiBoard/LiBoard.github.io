# Hardware
## Components
These are the components I used, but you should be able to find alternatives
for most of them if necessary.
- **SparkFun Pro Micro (5V, 16MHz)**
- **64 photoresistors**
- **72 diodes**
- **Shift register**
- **8 resistors**
- **Cables and soldering supplies**

For potential alternatives, see [Design decisions](design-decisions).
