# Hardware
## Components
These are the components I used, but you should be able to find alternatives
for most of them if necessary.
I've included some replacement suggestions where applicable.
- **SparkFun Pro Micro (5V, 16MHz)**  
  - Alternatives: any Arduino-compatible microcontroller
  with sufficient (ideally >=8) analog inputs
- **64 photoresistors**  
  Alternatives:
  - Reed switches (need magnetic pieces)
  - Hall sensors (need magnetic pieces and different wiring)
  - Induction sensors (need weighted pieces)
- **64 diodes**
- **Shift register**
  - Can be omitted if enough digital outputs are available
- **8 resistors**
- **Cables and soldering supplies**
