title: Python module & scripts

# {{ page.title }}
A Python module for using LiBoard on a computer can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/LiBoard/Python).
This repo also contains some scripts for common use cases (playing with the Lichess Board API, saving OTB games as a PGN).
Run the scripts with the `--help` option to see information about their arguments.
